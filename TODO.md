# TODO: Project Enhancements

## Functionality

## Code Quality

- rename cliAction to cliActionCommand
- move cliActionCommand to commands directory
- rename generateRounds to generateRoundsCommand
- move outputFormatter to formatters directory
- prevent pushing directly to remote master branch

## Project Configuration

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning practices
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)

## Additional Tooling to Consider

- [ ] Commitlint for enforcing consistent commit messages (works well with ðŸ“¦ Semantic Release)
- [ ] Semantic Release for automating version management and package publishing
- [ ] Telemetry to understand usage
