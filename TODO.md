- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to functions, especially in `src/swissPairing.ts`

- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)

## Additional Tooling to Consider

- [ ] Commitlint for enforcing consistent commit messages (works well with ðŸ“¦ Semantic Release)
- [ ] Semantic Release for automating version management and package publishing
- [ ] Code complexity analysis (e.g., SonarQube)
- [ ] Dependency visualization (e.g., Dependency Cruiser)
