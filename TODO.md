# TODO: Project Enhancements

## In Progress

- Telemetry using PostHog
  - stricter typing for events
  - discriminate between test/dev and production users
  - simplify point of use
  - add tests
  - rename files in telemetry module
  - add code documentation
  - mention telemetry in readme

## Functionality

## Code Quality

- prevent pushing directly to remote master branch

## Project Configuration

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning practices
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)

## Additional Tooling to Consider

- [ ] Commitlint for enforcing consistent commit messages (works well with ðŸ“¦ Semantic Release)
- [ ] Semantic Release for automating version management and package publishing
