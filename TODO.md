# TODO: Project Enhancements

## Functionality

- The term player should be replaced by Team. Matches are a game between teams, not players.
- CSV headers are currently case-sensitive, but need not be?

## Code Quality

- standardise error messages in swissPairing/validation
- rename JSONRecord and CSVRecord to something more clear
- add more integration tests which cover the whole range of arguments

## Project Configuration

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning practices
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)

## Additional Tooling to Consider

- [ ] Commitlint for enforcing consistent commit messages (works well with ðŸ“¦ Semantic Release)
- [ ] Semantic Release for automating version management and package publishing
