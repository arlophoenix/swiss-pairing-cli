# TODO: Project Enhancements

## Functionality

## Code Quality

- review documentation for updates after the SwissPairingResult refactor
- prevent pushing directly to remote master branch

## Project Configuration

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning practices
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)

## Additional Tooling to Consider
