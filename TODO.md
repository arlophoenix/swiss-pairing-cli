# TODO: Project Enhancements

## Functionality

## Code Quality

- standardise error messages in swissPairing/validation
- refactor the output type to an array of objects
  - include round #, label etc
  - consider including the squad names in the output?
- prevent pushing directly to remote master branch

## Project Configuration

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning practices
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)

## Additional Tooling to Consider

- [ ] Commitlint for enforcing consistent commit messages (works well with ðŸ“¦ Semantic Release)
- [ ] Semantic Release for automating version management and package publishing
- [ ] Telemetry to understand usage
