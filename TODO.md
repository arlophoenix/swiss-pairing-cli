- Telemetry using PostHog
  - add env variable to force telemetry notification display
  - add integration test to test telemetry notification
  - enable telemetry for production (how to securely store API key?)
  - mention telemetry in readme

## Functionality

## Code Quality

- consider refactor to extract cliAction to separate command
- Review code coverage
- prevent pushing directly to remote master branch

## Documentation

- Scripts
  - Add a section on scripts to the readme
  - Document the scripts
- Debug
  - Add a section on debug logging to the readme

## Project Configuration

- Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)

- [ ] Implement semantic versioning practices
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)
- Add dependency visualization

## Additional Tooling to Consider

- [ ] Commitlint for enforcing consistent commit messages (works well with ðŸ“¦ Semantic Release)
