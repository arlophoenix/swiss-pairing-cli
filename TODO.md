# TODO: Project Enhancements

## TypeScript and Code Quality
- [ ] Set up path aliases in `tsconfig.json` for cleaner imports
- [ ] Enhance error handling in CLI tool (`src/index.ts`)
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to functions, especially in `src/swissPairing.ts`
- [ ] Set up test coverage thresholds and reporting in Jest configuration

## Project Configuration
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement semantic versioning practices
- [ ] Implement automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot)

## Additional Tooling to Consider
- [ ] Commitlint for enforcing consistent commit messages (works well with ðŸ“¦ Semantic Release)
- [ ] Semantic Release for automating version management and package publishing
- [ ] Code complexity analysis (e.g., SonarQube)
- [ ] Dependency visualization (e.g., Dependency Cruiser)

## Project-Specific Enhancements
- [ ] Implement core Swiss pairing algorithm in `src/swissPairing.ts`
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test cases for pairing algorithm
- [ ] Create user documentation for CLI tool usage
